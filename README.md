# Abstract
NeuroLab: Physics‑Inspired Neural Dynamics Simulator
This project reimagines neural network training as a physical system evolving toward equilibrium. Built entirely from scratch in Python/NumPy, the framework treats the loss function as a potential energy surface, gradient descent as energy minimisation, and momentum as inertial mass. Each architecture becomes a dynamical configuration, where activation functions emulate nonlinear response behaviors and training trajectories resemble relaxation processes in classical mechanics.
The system supports configurable topologies, multiple activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU), mini‑batch training, and early stopping. A physics‑themed visualisation suite produces static and animated plots of “system energy” decay, comparative “energy relaxation” curves across configurations, and animated “phase diagram” evolutions that depict decision boundaries as phase transitions. All outputs are automatically saved for reproducibility and presentation.
By uniting transparent algorithmic implementation with physics‑inspired interpretation, NeuroLab serves as both a pedagogical tool for illustrating the mechanics of learning and a research scaffold for modelling complex dynamical systems. It invites students and researchers to explore neural networks not just as computational models, but as analogues of physical processes.
